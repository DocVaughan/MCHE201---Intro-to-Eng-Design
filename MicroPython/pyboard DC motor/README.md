This script demonstrates the basic functionality of a stepper motor using the pyboard connected over i2c to an Adafruit Motor Driver Shield.

This code requires the .mpy files from the [Adafruit repository](https://github.com/adafruit/micropython-adafruit-pca9685) linked to be on the pyboard.

The circuit on the shield is identical to the Feather board shown in that tutorial.

The hardware setup to use this script is shown below.
