This script demonstrates the basic functionality of a stepper motor using the pyboard connected over i2c to an Adafruit Motor Driver Shield.

This code requires the .mpy files from the [Dr. Vaughan's fork of the Adafruit repository](https://github.com/DocVaughan/micropython-adafruit-pca9685) to be on the pyboard. Be sure to get the files from the release corresponding to the version of MicroPython that you are using.

The circuit on the shield is identical to the Feather board shown in that tutorial.

The hardware setup to use this script is shown below.
