// Define the pin number of the buzzer and LED

//  * Make it easier to change the pin number later. We'd only have to change

  // define the buzzer pin as an output
  pinMode(BUZZER_PIN, OUTPUT);

  // Let's also set up the onboard LED as an output
  pinMode(LED, OUTPUT);

  // Now, let's beep once to let us know the set up function finished
