Main script to toggle a digital output on/off. In this case, we are using it to control a transistor, which is controlling a relay. The relay needs 5VDC to switch, so the pyboard cannot do so directly. We are effectively  using the transistor as a switch on the 5VDC power supply from the pyboard. The relay is connected to two LEDs. One is connected to the normally-closed output and will be on with the relay is not triggered. The other is connected to the normally-open output of the relay and will turn on when the relay is triggered.

The wiring should match that found in [Circuit 13 of the SparkFun SIK guide](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sik-experiment-guide-for-arduino---v33/all#experiment-13-using-relays). To use this script as is, connect the center pin (the base) of the NPN transistor to pin X7 of the pyboard.
