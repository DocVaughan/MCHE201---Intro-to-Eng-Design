## Notes during Porting
I'll keep a running list of notes during my effort to port the files to the feather. Once complete, I'll probably remove this file and add any information that's needed to the folder README

# Misc notes
* `help()` notes still reflect pyboard, not feather
* LED 1 = red LED next to USB C port - it's the only traditional LED on the board
